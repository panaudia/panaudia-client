# Panaudia Dockerfiles

You can use these Dockerfiles to build images to deploy Panaudia Space in containers or just as a reference for installing Panaudia Space.

There are two seperate builds at the moment, for amd64 and arm architectures:

- arm64
- amd64


To use the Dockerfiles you will have to download the matching pre-compiled binary from https://panaudia.com, 
unzip it next to the Dockerfile and then the build the image.
