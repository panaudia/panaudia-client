# Panaudia Dockerfiles

You can use these Dockerfiles to build images to deploy Panaudia Space in containers or just as a reference for installing Panaudia Space.

There are four seperate builds at the moment. Builds for amd64 and arm architectures and with and without Panaudia Link enabled:

- arm64
- arm64-link
- amd64
- amd64-link

To use the Dockerfiles you will have to download the matching pre-compiled binary from https://panaudia.com, 
unzip it next to the Dockerfile and then the build the image.
