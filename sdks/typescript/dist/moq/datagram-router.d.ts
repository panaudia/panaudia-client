/**
 * datagram-router.ts — the main-thread datagram dispatch: a trackAlias→handler
 * map plus the SUBSCRIBE_OK/first-datagram pre-handler race buffer.
 *
 * Extracted verbatim from `MoqConnection` (Phase 1 of worker-transport-plan.md) so
 * the *routing* is independent of the *transport*. Today `MoqConnection` composes
 * it and feeds it from its own read loop; once the transport moves into the worker
 * (Phase 2), this same router runs on the main thread fed by datagrams the worker
 * forwards — the subscribers register on it exactly as they register on the
 * connection today, so their code is unchanged.
 *
 * The race it guards: the server writes SUBSCRIBE_OK on the bidi control stream
 * and then immediately SendDatagram's backfilled objects on the unreliable QUIC
 * datagram channel; a datagram for a freshly-assigned trackAlias can arrive before
 * `await session.subscribe()` resolves and the handler is registered. Such
 * datagrams are buffered in arrival order and drained when the handler registers.
