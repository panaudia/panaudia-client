/**
 * capture-worklet.ts — the AudioWorklet wrapper around {@link CaptureRing} for the
 * mic SEND path (design: worker-capture-design.md §6/§6.1, plan Phase 3).
 *
 * This is the PRODUCER side, and it is deliberately trivial and real-time-safe: each
 * 128-sample render quantum is interleaved straight into the SAB ring and — if data
 * was written — the worker is woken via the clock-free signal (`Atomics.add` +
 * `Atomics.notify` on a shared Int32 cell, design §6.1). It does **no** Opus encode,
 * **no** frame-boundary logic, and **no** `postMessage` of PCM. Encode + framing +
 * send all live in the MOQ worker, which drains the ring (CaptureRing.drain).
 *
 * **Build-free loading.** A worklet loaded via Blob URL cannot `import` app modules at
 * runtime, so the (self-contained) {@link CaptureRing} class is serialized via
 * `.toString()` and concatenated with the processor source into one Blob — the same
 * pattern as the playout worklet. CaptureRing assigns its fields in the constructor
 * (no class-field initializers), so this serialization stays valid under any build
 * target (no `__publicField` helper to leak module scope).
